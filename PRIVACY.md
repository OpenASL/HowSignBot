## Privacy Policy

I only store data that are critical to operation and do not store more than is needed.

### What data do I store?

For most servers, no server or member data are stored.

For the Sign Cafe and American Sign Language servers, I store the following data for extended moderation and Zoom functionality:

- Server IDs
- Channel IDs for daily messages
- Discord user IDs
- User time zones
- Zoom meeting IDs, URLs, passcode, and topic for meetings created using one of the Zoom commands
- Zoom participant name, join time, and email (for the participant indicators)
  - These are only stored for the duration of the meeting. They are permanently deleted when a Zoom meeting ends.

The following are stored for the Sign Cafe server only:

- Scheduled event IDs
- Server join date
- Member roles
- Creation date of messages posted in #introductions

These are used to compute and kick inactive users and for server analytics.

**No message content is stored.**

### Where is my data stored?

All data are stored in a managed Heroku PostgreSQL database.

### I would like to have my data removed

Contact me. See below for contact info.

If you have any questions or concerns, send me a message over Discord (`sloria#0815`) or send me an email (`sloria1@gmail.com`).
